TODO:
    Start from hovering at gate center. Set episode length to 500, let it hover till the end.
    Also do imitation learning, use PID (for robustness) with attitude output as teacher policy, run simultaneously and compare output.

Train: lesson 1.0 Hover at gate
    time: Jun 10 06:07
    n_envs: 20
    steps: 2 * 400000
    duration: 20min
    changes: hover
    result: flying to gate but unstable
    comments: param works, keep training

Train: lesson 1.1
    time: Jun 10 07:21
    n_envs: 20
    steps: 6 * 400000
    duration: 38min
    changes: 
    result: fly and hover half meter in front of the gate, will do 
    comments: move to next lesson

Train: lesson 2.1 with obstacles
    time: Jun 10 07:21
    n_envs: 20
    steps: 4 * 400000
    duration: 27min
    changes: 
    result: avoid obstacles sometimes, still not going into the gate
    comments: increase k_gate

Train: lesson 2.2
    time: Jun 10 12:02
    n_envs: 20
    steps: 2 * 400000
    duration: 18min
    changes: +k_gate -k_gate_pos -k_obst -k_obst_d ++k_success
    result: afraid of going through the gate
    comments: decrease r, increase k_gate

Train: lesson 2.3
    time: Jun 10 12:37
    n_envs: 20
    steps: 2 * 400000
    duration: 18min
    changes: +k_gate -r
    result: still afraid, but better collision avoidance
    comments: try next lesson in racing environment

Train: lesson 3.1 Racing environment with imitation learning
    n_envs: 20
    steps: 6 * 400000
    duration: 38min
    changes: +k_gate -r
    result: still stop in front of the gates?? why?
    comments: perhaps caused by r_center 

Train: lesson 3.2 Racing environment with imitation learning
    n_envs: 20
    steps: 6 * 400000
    duration: 38min
    changes: -r_center
    result: still stop

Train: lesson 3.3 Racing environment with imitation learning
    n_envs: 20
    steps: 6 * 400000
    duration: 38min
    changes: +k_vel +k_imit +k_success
    result: just won't get in the fxxking gate
    comments: I might just try start from scratch

Train: lesson 4.0 Racing environment with imitation learning from scratch
    n_envs: 20
    steps: 6 * 400000
    duration: 56min
    changes: recreate model
    result: works pretty nice! able to pass four gates! However directly crashes on original takeoff position.
    comments: I'll add original start position and retrain a model.

Train: lesson 4.1 Racing environment with imitation learning from scratch
    n_envs: 20
    steps: 12 * 400000
    duration: 86min
    changes: add takeoff position, + k_vel
    result: moving faster, but not stable

Train: lesson 4.2 Racing environment with random gate
    n_envs: 20
    steps: 6 * 400000
    duration: 38min
    changes: remove imitation learning, add random gates
    result:

Train: lesson 4.3 Racing environment Level 2 
    n_envs: 20
    steps: 2 * 400000
    duration: 38min
    changes: remove imitation learning, add random gates
    result: working fine observed success rate over 50%, avg 6s
    comments: keep going
    
Train: lesson 4.4 Racing environment Level 2 
    n_envs: 20
    steps: 2 * 400000
    duration: 38min
    changes: add finish reward, remove rand init, +k_vel, flip k_vel at 3rd gate
    result: working fine observed success rate over 50%, avg 6s
    comments: keep going
